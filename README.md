# InfElem
Herein is included 2 numerical codes for simulating the stream seepage to an infinite phreatic aquifer by implementing the infinite elements in the finite element analysis.

The 1st code approximate the problem as one-dimensional saturated groundwater flow described by the Boussinesq equation and the 2nd code as two-dimensional saturated-unsaturated groundwater flow described by the Richards equation. For each code are included the executable file, the source file and the input data files.

Both numerical codes were developed by Ch. Doulgeris in FORTRAN 95.
